# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the use of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when provided with an empty array.  The issue arises when querying documents where the specified field might be null, undefined, or simply absent, resulting in unexpected behavior.

## Problem
A query like `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` is expected to return all documents where 'field' is null or undefined in most databases, but in MongoDB this returns an empty result set. This can lead to incorrect data retrieval and application logic errors.

## Solution
The solution involves using an alternative approach that handles the cases where the field may not exist or is empty.  This can be achieved using `$or` operator or by checking for `null` or `undefined` explicitly.
